Calculates the signed area / LÃ©vy area of a 2D path. If the path is closed,
i.e. ends where it starts, this is the integral of the winding number over
the whole plane. If not, consider a closed path made by adding a straight
line from the end to the start; the signed area is the integral of the
winding number (also over the plane) with respect to that closed path.

If this number is positive, it indicates in some sense that the path
turns anticlockwise more than clockwise, and vice versa.

Simple best fitting of a circle to 2D points. In particular, the circle which
minimizes the sum of the squares of the squared-distances to the circle.

Finds (a,b) and r to minimize the sum of squares (over the x,y pairs) of

In addition, generates points along the circle. If angles is None (default)
then n_points around the circle equally spaced are given. These begin at the
point closest to the first input point. They continue in the direction which
seems to match the movement of points in points2d, as judged by its
signed area. If `angles` are provided, then n_points is ignored, and points
along the circle at the given angles are returned, with the starting point
and direction as before.

points2d, but the other outputs are not.)
